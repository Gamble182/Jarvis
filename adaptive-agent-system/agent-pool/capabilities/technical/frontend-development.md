# Frontend Development Capability

## Domain Knowledge
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript
- React, Vue, Svelte, or other frameworks
- HTML5 and semantic markup
- CSS3, Flexbox, Grid
- Responsive design implementation
- State management (Redux, Context, Zustand)
- API integration and data fetching
- Form handling and validation
- Authentication flows (JWT, OAuth)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Browser compatibility
- Testing (Jest, Testing Library, E2E)
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack, etc.)

## Thinking Patterns
- Component-based architecture
- Performance optimization: Bundle size, rendering efficiency
- User experience: Smooth interactions, loading states
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML, ARIA
- Progressive enhancement: Works without JavaScript
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Error handling and user feedback

## Output Formats
- Component code (React, Vue, etc.)
- Reusable UI component library
- API integration layer
- State management setup
- Routing configuration
- Build configuration
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance optimization report

## Required Context
- UX designs and wireframes
- API specifications
- Browser support requirements
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Framework preferences or constraints
- Existing codebase (if any)

## Collaboration
- **Provides to**:
  - backend-developer (API requirements, data shape needs)
  - ux-designer (feedback on feasibility, improvements)
- **Receives from**:
  - ux-designer (designs, user flows)
  - backend-developer (API specs)
  - system-architect (tech stack decisions)

## Key Questions This Capability Answers
- What framework/library is most appropriate?
- How to structure components for reusability?
- How to manage application state?
- How to optimize for performance?
- How to ensure accessibility?
- How to handle API errors and loading states?
- What testing strategy to use?
