# System Architecture Capability

## Domain Knowledge
- Software architecture patterns (monolith, microservices, serverless)
- System design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
- Scalability patterns
- Database architecture (SQL vs. NoSQL, normalization)
- API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Caching strategies
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- Security architecture
- Performance optimization

## Thinking Patterns
- Requirements-driven design: Architecture serves business needs
- Trade-off analysis: Performance vs. complexity vs. cost
- Scalability planning: Current needs vs. future growth
- Technology selection: Evaluate options objectively
- Risk assessment: Identify architectural risks early
- Modularity: Design for change and maintainability
- Security-first mindset: Build security into architecture

## Output Formats
- System architecture diagram (C4 model, component diagrams)
- Technology stack recommendation with rationale
- Data flow diagrams
- API specification outline
- Infrastructure architecture diagram
- Security architecture document
- Scalability plan
- Technical risk assessment
- Migration strategy (if applicable)

## Required Context
- Business requirements and constraints
- Expected user load and growth projections
- Budget constraints
- Team technical expertise
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- Integration requirements
- Performance requirements
- Availability requirements (SLA)

## Collaboration
- **Provides to**:
  - backend-developer (API specs, database schema)
  - frontend-developer (API contracts)
  - devops-engineer (infrastructure requirements)
  - security-specialist (security requirements)
- **Receives from**:
  - business-strategist (business requirements)
  - mvp-planner (feature scope, priorities)
  - compliance-advisor (regulatory requirements)

## Key Questions This Capability Answers
- What is the optimal architecture for this use case?
- Which technology stack should we use and why?
- How will the system scale as usage grows?
- What are the key architectural risks?
- How should data flow through the system?
- What security measures are needed?
- How should we handle authentication and authorization?
- What is the deployment strategy?
