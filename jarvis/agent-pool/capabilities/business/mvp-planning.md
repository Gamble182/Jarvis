# MVP Planning Capability

## Domain Knowledge
- Lean startup methodology
- MVP definition and scope
- Feature prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, Kano)
- User story mapping
- Agile planning principles
- Validation metrics
- Build-measure-learn cycles
- Minimum viable features vs. complete features

## Thinking Patterns
- Essential vs. nice-to-have differentiation
- Risk-based prioritization: What must be validated first?
- User journey mapping: Minimum path to value
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Iterative refinement: Plan for learning and pivoting
- Constraint-based planning: Work within budget/timeline limits

## Output Formats
- MVP feature list (prioritized)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- MVP scope document
- Phase/sprint breakdown
- Success metrics and validation criteria
- Risk matrix
- Timeline estimation (phases, not dates)

## Required Context
- Business model and value proposition
- Target user personas
- Technical constraints
- Budget and resource constraints
- Time to market considerations
- Competitive pressure
- Core problem being solved

## Collaboration
- **Provides to**:
  - technical-architect (feature requirements, scope)
  - ux-designer (user flows, key features)
  - financial-planner (scope for cost estimation)
  - development-team (implementation roadmap)
- **Receives from**:
  - business-strategist (business goals, constraints)
  - market-analyst (user research, competitive features)
  - technical-architect (feasibility, complexity estimates)

## Key Questions This Capability Answers
- What is the minimum feature set to validate the business hypothesis?
- Which features are must-have for MVP vs. post-MVP?
- What can be faked, manual, or simplified in the MVP?
- How will we measure MVP success?
- What is the scope creep risk and how to mitigate it?
- What is the optimal MVP release strategy?
