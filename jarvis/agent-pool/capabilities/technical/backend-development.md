# Backend Development Capability

## Domain Knowledge
- Server-side programming (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- RESTful API design
- GraphQL
- Database interaction (ORMs, query builders)
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth2, sessions)
- API security (rate limiting, input validation, CORS)
- Background jobs and task queues
- Email sending and templating
- File upload and storage
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory)
- Logging and monitoring
- Error handling and validation
- Testing (unit, integration, API tests)
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Thinking Patterns
- API-first design: Clear contracts
- Security-first: Validate all inputs, authenticate all requests
- Separation of concerns: Controllers, services, repositories
- Error handling: Graceful failures, clear error messages
- Performance: Optimize queries, use caching
- Scalability: Design for horizontal scaling
- Maintainability: Clean code, good documentation

## Output Formats
- API implementation code
- Database models/schemas
- Authentication middleware
- API documentation (OpenAPI spec)
- Background job definitions
- Email templates
- Unit and integration tests
- Deployment scripts/configuration

## Required Context
- API specifications
- Database schema
- Authentication requirements
- Third-party integrations
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Deployment environment

## Collaboration

  - devops-engineer (deployment requirements)
- **Receives from**:
  - system-architect (architecture, tech stack)
  - database-designer (schema, models)
  - security-specialist (security requirements)
